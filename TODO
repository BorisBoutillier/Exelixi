-- Ecosystem
. Save/Load population, with config
. Add the reach of the Mouth as fixed energy cost, and also a gene 
. Use a spatial data structure to look for organism eating each-other.
. Add support for Eye to have two sensors per cell 'distance' and 'energy' of closest
. Add support for Eye to have three sensors per eye 'distance', 'energy', 'hue'

-- User Interaction
. Add a 'Selection' panel, that show data from currently selected organism:
  A collaspable header per Component.
. Add a configuration panel that show current configuration.
  Allow to edit/save and reset current simulation configuration
. Improve user camera interaction:
    . Make panning around follow environment 'scale'
