-- Code
. Update Eye to see only edible organisms.
. Update Eye cells to only sense closest edible organism
. Update statistics to support organism names.
    Report end_of generation survivors per name.
    Report eaten per generation per name
    Report dead as out of energy per generation per name.
. Remove OrganismKind
. Should at this point be able to do a config with Plant, Herbivore and Carnivore.

. Fix lost determinism when changing mouth eating algorithm
. Make simulation systems and needed components as a plugin
. Save/Load population, with config
. Use a spatial data structure to look for organism eating each-other.
. Add the reach of the Mouth as fixed energy cost, and also a gene 
. Add support for Eye to also see 'hue' as second sensor per cell, and see all organism.

-- User Interaction
. Improve user camera interaction:
    . Make panning around follow environment 'scale'
. Have a drop down panel for Simulation, Population, Organism, openable/closable through F4/F5/F6
  Simulation show evolution through generation data.
    
  Population show current population data:
    Number alive, stats per parts
  Organism show currently selected organism data.
. Status bar with a progress bar of steps within the generation

. Update on simulation interaction:
    Allow a 'skip N' input command where N entered by user (default 10)
