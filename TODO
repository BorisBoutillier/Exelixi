-- Code
. Make simulation systems and needed components as a plugin
. Save/Load population, with config
. Fix incoherency in energy data types
. Replace Food with a Plant organism:
    New to add an organism kind, wiht Plant and Herbivore.
. Include evolution of organism in the component:
    Plant auto-spawn
    Herbivore use genetic evolution
. add an edible type to the Mouth component, an array of organism kinds.
    Use a spatial data structure to look for organism eating each-other.
    Try to eat the closest eatable, within its 'reach'
    When competing for one items, the closest eat it.
    Add the reach of the Mouth as fixed energy cost, and also a gene 

-- User Interaction
. Improve user camera interaction:
    . Make panning around follow environment 'scale'
. Have a drop down panel for Simulation, Population, Organism, openable/closable through F4/F5/F6
  Simulation show evolution through generation data.
    
  Population show current population data:
    Number alive, stats per parts
  Organism show currently selected organism data.
. Status bar with a progress bar of steps within the generation

. Update on simulation interaction:
    Allow a 'skip N' input command where N entered by user (default 10)
