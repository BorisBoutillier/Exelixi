-- Bugs
. Mouse simulation interactions no more working.
. Fix lost determinism when changing mouth eating algorithm

-- Code
. UI:
  . Add a 'Selection' panel, that show data from currently selected organism:
    A collaspable header per Component.
  . Add a configuration panel that show current configuration.
    Allow to edit/save and reset current simulation configuration

. Save/Load population, with config
. Add the reach of the Mouth as fixed energy cost, and also a gene 
. Use a spatial data structure to look for organism eating each-other.
. Add support for Eye to have two sensors per cell 'distance' and 'energy' of closest
. Add support for Eye to have three sensors per eye 'distance', 'energy', 'hue'

-- User Interaction
. Improve user camera interaction:
    . Make panning around follow environment 'scale'
. Update on simulation interaction:
    Allow a 'skip N' input command where N entered by user (default 10)
