-- Code
. Make simulation systems and needed components as a plugin

-- User Interaction
. Improve user camera interaction:
    . Make panning around follow environment 'scale'
. User edition of the simulation configuration
    . As a modal pane ?
. Generation statistics:
    . avg energy per tick ?
. Population statistics:
    . chromosome histograms:
        histogram on number of eyes.
. Save/Load population
. Update on simulation interaction:
    . Allow to trigger N generation advances:
        Then run at normal speed
        And show last generation statitiscs
. Allow clicking an organism to see its state:
    . plot with evolution of the energy level.
-- Fix incoherency in energy data types
