-- User Interaction
. Allow user to move the Camera:
    . Click + move = move around the environment
    . Wheel Up/Down = Unzoom/zoom
    . Middle Click : Recenter on environment
. Allow user modification of the simulation configuraton
. Status bar show current simulation status ( age/generation/stats)
. Allow interaction with simulation speed (pause/start/)

-- Simulation
. Replace Stomach Satiation, with body energy management:
    . Give a cost to each action:
        . process vision
            Based on number of cells and fov_range, fov_angle.
        . process_brain
            Based on non-epsilon weights
        . process_movement:
            exponential cost of linear/angular velocity
    . Eating food raise energy.
