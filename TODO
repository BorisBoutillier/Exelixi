-- User Interaction
. Improve user camera interaction:
    . Improve update on window resize 
    . Keep environment aspect ratio.
    . Make panning around follow environment 'scale'
. Allow user modification of the simulation configuraton
    Restart a new simulation on change.
. Save/Load population
. Save/Load configuration
. Allow clicking an animal to see its state:
    . fov_range/fov_angle drawn
    . plot with evolution of the energy level.
    

-- Simulation
. Single system for doing simulation steps ?
    . This would allow a kind of 'step per frame' ?
. Replace Stomach Satiation, with body energy management:
    . Give a cost to each action:
        . process vision
            Based on number of cells and fov_range, fov_angle.
        . process_brain
            Based on non-epsilon weights
        . process_movement:
            exponential cost of linear/angular velocity
    . Eating food raise energy.
. Allow to see other animals
    A new set of values from eyes ?
. Allow an output neuron to control usage of eyes.
    . On output for each eye ?  <0.4 disable, >-.6 enable , in-between don't touch ?
. New genes to control the fov_range/fov_angle:
    Impacts on energy based on 'visible' area.
. New genes to control number of eyes.
