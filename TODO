-- Code
. Make simulation systems and needed components as a plugin
. Improve multi-ticks per frame behaviour:
    . Does this need an exclusive system wiht a custom schedule ?

-- User Interaction
. Improve user camera interaction:
    . Make panning around follow environment 'scale'
. User edition of the simulation configuration
    . As a modal pane ?
. Generation statistics:
    . avg energy per tick ?
. Population statistics:
    . chromosome histograms:
        histogram on number of eyes.
. Save/Load population
. Update on simulation interaction:
    . Allow to trigger N generation advances:
        Then run at normal speed
        And show last generation statitiscs
. Allow clicking an animal to see its state:
    . plot with evolution of the energy level.

-- Simulation
. Replace Stomach Satiation, with body energy management:
    . Give a cost to each action:
        . process vision
            Based on number of cells and fov_range, fov_angle.
        . process_brain
            Based on non-epsilon weights
        . process_movement:
            exponential cost of linear/angular velocity
    . Eating food raise energy.
. Allow to see other animals
    A new set of values from eyes ?
. Allow an output neuron to control usage of eyes.
    . On output for each eye ?  <0.4 disable, >-.6 enable , in-between don't touch ?
. New genes to control the fov_range/fov_angle:
    Impacts on energy based on 'visible' area.
. New genes to control number of eyes.
. Add a new kind of carnivor animal, able to eat herbivors.
