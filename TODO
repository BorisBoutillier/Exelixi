-- Bugs
   with default cargo run, in GUI, a food blink at the exact middle of environment.
  . Reproductibility issues remains.
  . Uterus processing bug with HerbivoreCarnivoteFullEye -> panic!
-- Short term:
  - Allow to run for a single step ( in GUI)
  - Center around Chromosome instead of Individual.
  - Try to make Chromosome extraction and Organism building independent of Organ with Chromosome, through traits
  - Make Organ GUI display a trait, so as GUI can be agnostics to number of organs.
--- Ecosystem
- ECS:
  - Add support for Simulation config auto-saving to a directory, with directory and save rate configurable.
    We could also save the inline_stats for this steps in a txt file next to it. XX.ecosim and XX.stats ?
  - Optimize KdTree to for quasi 'static' species ( only appear and die, do not move)
  - Converts standard component behaviour as traits :
      - Sensor
      - Actuator
  - should kdtree include multiple time same entity for torus worlds ( without wall)
  - Check if having an OrganismBundle make code cleaner

- Body:
  - What about an 'age' attribute. The number of ticks since birth of this organism.
    - Sensor in the brain
    - Birth could be associated to age, as a gene ? Minimum/Maximum age to give birth ?
- Mouth:
  - Add the reach of the Mouth as fixed energy cost, and also a gene 
- Eye:
  - Add hue of the wall as black
  - Move process_vision out of brain into its own system
- Brain:
  - Add hidden layer topology in config:
    - ex: [2S,3S,2A] = 3 hidden layers, 2*n_sensors, 3*n_sensors, 2*n_actuactors.
  - Can we use existing neuron crates ? [dfdx]
  - Can we do reinforcement learning during 'life', evolving copy current state.
  - Support edge with 0 value between neurons.
    Cannot change during reinforcement learning.
    Mutation can go from 0 -> non-zero or reverse.
    Base cost of brain on number of non-0 edges.

- Reproduction:
  - Add reproduction through Birth, with a new Uterus organ
    - Contacts with co-organisms store their genetics of other in Uterus, only last one.
    - Energy_for_birth is a gene value.
    - Give birth when reaching energy_for_birth, create child from self and stored genetics with half 'start' energy, that self loses.
    - On death, if will go under min_population, spawn a new random one. We probably need to keep a count of population size.
    - Should Uterus be controlled by brain actuator ( open/closed), to allow selection of partners ?
    - Should mating take time ( preventing Locomotion), should Birth take time ?

- Statistics:
  - Performance aggregation of stats to max length, through merges. (1/3 kept 2/3 merged 2 by twos -> 2/3)

  
-- User Interaction
[!] Add a 'Selection' panel, that show data from currently selected organism:
  - A collaspable header per Component.
- Add a configuration panel that show current configuration.
  Allow to edit/save and reset current simulation configuration
- Improve user camera interaction:
    . Make panning around follow environment 'scale'
- Update on simulation interaction:
    Allow a 'skip N' input command where N entered by user (default 10)
