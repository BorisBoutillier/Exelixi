-- Bugs
- After update to 0.14:
  - Saving implementation removed
- load and run_for do not work together, load run-for and save should work all three together
- load + run + config gives different results that just load + run

--- Ecosystem
- Save/Load:
  - Take advantage of DynamicScene now supporting resources
- ECS:
  - Save/Load should include 'git' checksum. And Warning in stdout when not matching, but still load.
  - Should we save to directory to save with steps as name, and allow a save_every command line argument ?
    We could also save the inline_stats for this steps in a txt file next to it. XX.ecosim and XX.stats ?
  - Optimize KdTree to for quasi 'static' species ( only appear and die, do not move)
  - Converts standard component behaviour as traits :
      - Sensor
      - Actuator
      - EnergyConsummer
  - should kdtree include multiple time same entity for torus worlds ( without wall)
  - Check if having an OrganismBundle make code cleaner

- Config:
  - Move config file to yaml or json.

- Mouth:
  - Add the reach of the Mouth as fixed energy cost, and also a gene 

- Eye:
  - Add hue of the wall as black
  - Move process_vision out of brain into its own system

- Brain:
  - Add hidden layer topology in config:
    - ex: [2S,3S,2A] = 3 hidden layers, 2*n_sensors, 3*n_sensors, 2*n_actuactors.
  - Can we use existing neuron crates ? [dfdx]
  - Can we do reinforcement learning during 'life', evolving copy current state.
  - Support edge with 0 value between neurons.
    Cannot change during reinforcement learning.
    Mutation can go from 0 -> non-zero or reverse.
    Base cost of brain on number of non-0 edges.
  
- Reproduction:
  - Add reproduction through Birth.
    - Contacts with co-organisms store their genetics.
    - Give birth when reaching max-energy, create child from self and stored genetics with half 'start' energy, that self loses.

- Statistics:
  - Performance aggregation of stats to max length, through merges. (1/3 kept 2/3 merged 2 by twos -> 2/3)

  
-- User Interaction
[!] Add a 'Selection' panel, that show data from currently selected organism:
  - A collaspable header per Component.
- Add a configuration panel that show current configuration.
  Allow to edit/save and reset current simulation configuration
- Improve user camera interaction:
    . Make panning around follow environment 'scale'
- Update on simulation interaction:
    Allow a 'skip N' input command where N entered by user (default 10)
