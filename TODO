-- Bugs
- Fix lost determinism when changing mouth eating algorithm

--- Ecosystem
- ECS:
  - Save/Load population, with config to file. Should include 'git' checksum
  - Optimize KdTree to for quasi 'static' species ( only appear and die, do not move)
  - Converts standard component behaviour as traits :
      - Sensor
      - Actuator
      - EnergyConsummer
  - should kdtree include multiple time same entity for torus worlds ( without wall)

- Config:
  - Move config file to yaml or json.

- Mouth:
  - Add the reach of the Mouth as fixed energy cost, and also a gene 

- Eye:
  - Add hue of the wall as black
  - Move process_vision out of brain into its own system

- Brain:
  - Add hidden layer topology in config:
    - ex: [2S,3S,2A] = 3 hidden layers, 2*n_sensors, 3*n_sensors, 2*n_actuactors.
  - Can we use existing neuron crates ? [dfdx]
  - Can we do reinforcement learning during 'life', evolving copy current state.
  - Support edge with 0 value between neurons.
    Cannot change during reinforcement learning.
    Mutation can go from 0 -> non-zero or reverse.
    Base cost of brain on number of non-0 edges.
  
- Reproduction:
  - AutoSpawn:
    add a min_spawn_distance_from_eater:
      Defines that a spawn must be from any potential eaters.
  - GenerationEvolution:
    add a spawn distance from existing population for new generation ?
  - Add reproduction through Birth.
    - Contacts with co-organisms store their genetics.
    - Give birth when reaching max-energy, create child from self and stored genetics with half 'start' energy, that self loses.

- Statistics:
  - Performance aggregation of stats to max length, through merges. (1/3 kept 2/3 merged 2 by twos -> 2/3)

  
-- User Interaction
[!] Add a 'Selection' panel, that show data from currently selected organism:
  - A collaspable header per Component.
- Add a configuration panel that show current configuration.
  Allow to edit/save and reset current simulation configuration
- Improve user camera interaction:
    . Make panning around follow environment 'scale'
- Update on simulation interaction:
    Allow a 'skip N' input command where N entered by user (default 10)
